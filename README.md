## Overview
The Career Day Sorter is a modular sorter for students in Career Day, used for Pascack Hills Career Day 2019. Though designed for a specific purpose, this application can be repurposed for many different events. 

Pascack Hills's Career Day operates with the overarching premise which students go to the sessions they most prefer. A student will input their top five presenters, and will be sorted into three taking them into account. Reading either a CSV of students, or accepting manual input, this application takes their preferences and runs them through an algorithm to seat them in their most-preferred sessions possible. The algorithm takes into account a student's class, timeliness in filling out the application, and the popularity of the sessions they do sign up for. While doing this, the sessions available are also sorted into classrooms according to their popularity among students. After assigning all students and sessions, the application allows for manual movement and input before outputting all information to a CSV. From here, the user can either handle the data themselves or tell the program to email all students their session and room assignments.   

## Install And Run
Career Day is an application written in Java for Mac OSX. It uses scripts that only work on Mac, and therefore will not work on Windows. The app itself will work as a runnable jar, but is not packaged fully as a .app file in this repository. The .app file is only intended for use by Pascack Hills High School.
